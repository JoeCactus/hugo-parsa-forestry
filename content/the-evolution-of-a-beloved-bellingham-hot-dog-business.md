Marc Ravaris, known to many as El Capitan, putters around his shop, polishing all the already-shining hot water baths and vents, showing affection for his restaurant. After three locations and 16 years of slinging hot dogs, it’s clear Ravaris cares about what he does.

The Bellingham-based entrepreneur has been running El Capitan’s Gourmet Sausages and Pretzels since he began with a rolling hot dog stand 16 years ago on Vendor’s Row at Western.

Over the years, two other locations have been established as Ravaris has solidified his presence downtown.

He approaches customers with a friendly smile, a pep in his step and in some cases, greets them on a first-name basis.

Ravaris attended Western from 1979 to 1986, getting his first degree in environmental education, he said. In 1986 he started an audio company in Seattle, but left Seattle and returned to Bellingham in pursuit of less traffic, a Spanish degree and a certification to teach English as a second language.

These degrees in combination with a business run through his boat netted him the nickname “El Capitan.” When he started the first iteration of the hot dog stand, Ravaris said “pirates were huge,” inspiring the restaurant’s theme.

The location at 1201 Cornwall Ave. is currently the only shop bearing the El Capitan’s name. The shop is well lit, well located and according to Ravaris, happy to serve late-night customers.

El Capitan’s is now also expanding their hours to be open to a lunch crowd, according to Ravaris. Open Tuesday through Saturday, 11:30 a.m. to 2 a.m., Ravaris will be selling bratwurst, hot dogs, sausages and now even fries.

Despite the boisterous attitude of the late-night crowd, they are Ravaris’ main customer base, he said.

Around 10 p.m., Ravaris said the shop gets a little more exciting, so he cranks the music up for the younger crowd. One might imagine that hot dogs day in and day out would get old, but this is not the case for Ravaris.

“I try to eat a hot dog for pure enjoyment every two or three weeks,” Ravaris said.

Ravaris said El Capitan’s most popular “basic” dog is the Polish sausage, a traditional hot dog experience with a quarter pound of beef and pork for $5.25.

Of their specialties, Ravaris says the winner is The X.O., a quarter-pound of pepper and smoked sausage with two strips of bacon, cream cheese, grilled onions and a drizzle of BBQ which runs for $7.75.

They also offer jumbo pretzels, french fries, chili and potato chips, along with drink options like beer, cider, wine and kombucha.

From 4 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. is happy hour, where for $10 customers can get a sausage and a pint of beer.

The shop recently experienced the theft of a photo of El Capitan Manager Zac Cote, who started with Ravaris 10 years ago was taken from the restaurant. In the photo was standing in front of the old Cornwall Avenue location holding a pair of sausages, smiling.

“We were very surprised,” Ravaris said. “It’s not that we haven’t had things stolen here before, I mean a bit of shrinkage is unfortunately common to any business. It was one of those things that was priceless only to us.”

If there’s one thing that Ravaris is excited about in the new location, it’s the location itself. The pirate-paraphernalia on display makes El Capitan’s stand out, the outdoor seating and large, corner windows offers guests a view.
