**Ongoing Projects:**

_“Voices of the Salish Sea” project:_

Currently formatted as a copy-edited Q&A with various significant players in the Salish Sea ecological management system, this project is intended to give an overview of what those who spend their lives working for the health of the Salish Sea are motivated by, and spend their time thinking about.

[_“Hope for the Salish Sea” project:_](https://wp.wwu.edu/salishsea/hope-for-the-salish-sea/)

Begun in the Winter of 2018, the Salish Sea Institute intends this project to be a counter to the significant undercurrent of despair in environmental news and activism. Through the Hope program, we share positive news, accomplishments, science and opportunities for solutions related to environmental recovery as well as teach about the Salish sea, on and off campus. This Hopeful orientation is meant to help focus people to a “solutions” based orientation for their work, without closing their eyes to the problems facing the Salish Sea

**Finished Projects:**

_“Who is the Salish Sea Institute?” video_

Produced to be a helpful tool for those curious about the Salish Sea Institute, in a format that’s easy for publication in a variety of mediums, such as social media, on the SSI website, or shared at a conference.

_“Salish Sea Studies Minor now available at WWU” press release_

Meant to be a tool for news organizations to have so that content produced about the SALI minor was accurate, and comprehensible without additional information.
