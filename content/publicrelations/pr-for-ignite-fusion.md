[_History of IGNITE Fusion_](https://wp.wwu.edu/alexmeacham/files/2019/11/History-of-IGNITE.docx)

IGNITE has a longer, more varied history than what the average person knows. This was intended to highlight that history, and the reason for the odd Thursday night timeslot.

[_IGNITE FAQ_](https://wp.wwu.edu/alexmeacham/files/2019/11/IGNITE-FAQ.docx)

The average person is likely pretty freaked out by the concept of dancing with strangers, an FAQ is intended to answer some questions and quell some of their fears.

**Upcoming projects:**

_“This is IGNITE”_ video

IGNITE and overall, fusion, is a very vibrant, colorful and “videogenic” platform, so a video to help people get interested in IGNITE makes a lot of sense.
