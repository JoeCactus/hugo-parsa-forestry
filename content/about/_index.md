I’m a graduated Environmental Studies / Journalism major at Western Washington University. I have experience in public relations, visual media production, editing, and of course journalism.

Use the menus above to navigate, I recommend checking out the “videos” tab, as well as the work I’ve done in public relations for the Salish Sea Institute and others.

My environmental niche is hope. Most environmental news is dour and depressing, so it is my goal to find and create good, hopeful news. Perhaps you could use some more hope in your life too?
